# Explainable DFU Classification

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model for classifying diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) into normal and abnormal categories. The approach uses **custom CNN model, transfer learning with VGG19 and EfficientNetB2** and incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to make predictions interpretable.

## Features

--**Custom CNN model**
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes the VGG19 and EfficientNetB2 model for accurate classification.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Explains model predictions using visualization techniques.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved a test accuracy of **99.05%**.

## Dataset

The dataset includes:
- **Patches**

## Usage

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yogi0342/Explainable_DFU_classification.git
cd Explainable_DFU_classification
